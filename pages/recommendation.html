  <h3>Nursultan Akhmetsha, Computer Science teacher</h3>
  <p>With the high expectations he sets for himself and the growth he has displayed through exploring his hobbies, taking research classes and engaging in competitions, I have seen his ability to grow as a student and as a person through the goals and motivation he portrays. In just one year, he has shown the integrity and responsibility useful for his aspirations as a Business Administration major. He participated in business course called “Bastau” which I think played a huge role in his choice. Also, he has been awarded the bronze medal in the “Wunder”, Android APP programming language competition and has successfully completed a rigorous Robotics course at his school. Shynggyskhan is also actively involved in sports competitions and has placed first in football and second in basketball tournaments. In addition to these accomplishments, he is learning to speak Dutch. I have put Shynggyskhan and his classmates through a challenging mathematics curriculum, but his dedication to learning has given him critical thinking skills and a deeper perception of mathematics and problem solving. This provides a vital source of skills that he can rely on in his chosen field of Business Administration. Shynggyskhan's goals notably include becoming an engineer and using his engineering skills to give back to his hometown of Shymkent, Kazakhstan to encourage economic growth in the community. He would like to use his education to promote growth within himself and relay it back to his country for innovative change. As his mathematics teacher, I feel Shynggyskhan is highly capable of achieving everything he sets his mind to. Shynggyskhan has displayed proper preparation for the upcoming rigor that is expected of an individual in higher education: initiative, responsibility, indomitable spirit, and professionalism. Through his relentless commitment to my class and his organization, work ethic and devotion, I believe he is a perfect candidate for your university and will be successful in his future endeavors. I am blessed to have a student like Shynggyskhan who views education as more than curriculum, but rather an opportunity to shape himself for the future. His driven character has shown through his ability to excel in all expectations. Shynggyskhan has been engaging with his peers, and a true asset to the educational environment at Nazarbayev Intellectual School in Shymkent, Kazakhstan. I highly recommend Shynggyskhan for anything he sets his mind to and cannot wait to hear of the remarkable things his future and passion will create.</p>

  <h3>Thomas Wemyss, Physics teacher</h3>
  <p>I am delighted to recommend Shynggyskhan Rapbek to your institution. He is an exceptional student with whom I have worked with over the course of the past year years. His grades are excellent and he has demonstrated a strong ability to learn physics through English. This is reflected through his IELTS results of 6,5 . Shynggyskhan is a very studious and considerate young man. He works very well with others and will patiently listen and respond to ideas. He is a very positive presence in physics class. Shynggyskhan will ask questions only when he needs and his questions are usually very well thought out and deep. He seems to enjoy physics and works very hard in and out of lessons. He does this with a positive disposition and this is welcomed by all of his teachers. His SAT is excellent with a 700 in Math and a 610 in reasoning. These results for me are not unexpected from his results in Physics. An excellent student and I know his other students are very complimentary about him. Shynggyskhan is a very driven student and he has participated in festival called “U:Hack”, football tournaments, programming and German outside of lessons. He has talked to me a number of times about his ideas with his enthusiasm very evident. He has won honours in all of these disciplines and has been participating in them during the course of his 5 years at the school. Shynggyskhan really is a very well rounded student and this is something that I have found impressive. I am delighted to recommend Shynggyskhan to any institution. I am certain that he would be a huge positive to the classes that she participates and to the institution as a whole.</p>
